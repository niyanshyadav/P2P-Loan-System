# P2P Loan System

A decentralized peer-to-peer loan system built on the Ethereum blockchain.


## About
===============

The P2P Loan System is a decentralized platform that enables individuals to lend and borrow funds directly, without the need for intermediaries. The system utilizes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate secure, transparent, and automated loan transactions.


## Vision
==========

Our vision is to create a decentralized financial ecosystem that empowers individuals to take control of their financial lives. We aim to provide a secure, transparent, and accessible platform for lending and borrowing, thereby promoting financial inclusion and economic growth.


## Features
==========

*   Decentralized lending and borrowing
*   Smart contract-based loan agreements

## Technical Requirements
=============================

*   Node.js (version 14 or higher)
*   Truffle Suite (version 5 or higher)
*   Web3.js (version 1.7 or higher)
*   Ethereum blockchain (Ropsten testnet or mainnet)
